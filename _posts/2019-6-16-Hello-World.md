title: Hello World ! TaDa !

It's going to be a long journey. So hang in tight, and enjoy the ride.

This blog will be my journal for the next couple of years, and would house majority of my writings about technology. I've decided not to use my own blog generator (will discuss more about it someday) because I want to know more about the features that it should have. Using github pages along with jekyll will surely serve the purpose.

Hope you guys will enjoy the journey.
