title: C v/s Python - Part 1
---

This blog post will directly compare programs written in C and Python to perform the same task.


Hello again. C has been one of the **ancient** languages in computer sciences and Python is the new funky kid out there, who's into almost everything. This post will directly compare the programs written in C and Python for the same task. So let's get to work.

The following programs are from the Book, "***Let Us C, by Yashavant Kanetkar***", but modified a bit to increase the complexity. For example, removing the limit on length on input, etc.

The following comparisons show that equivalent python programs are smaller as compared to their C counterparts. This feature is helpful for a lot of practical day programming but has a single drawback. This will be discussed in further posts. At last, have a look at this transformation. It would be unjust to call it small... it's nothing!

Thanks for your time. Happy coding.
